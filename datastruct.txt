CHAPTER 7 - Structuring Data

Dictionary is a mutable data structure that holds many values like a list. But dictionaties use keys as indexes and each key is mapped to a value (Pythons version of map from Java) 

my_cat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'age': 17}
my_cat[size] = fat

size being the key and fat being the value
