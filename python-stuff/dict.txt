CHAPTER 7 - Dictionaries and stuff

Dictionary is a mutable data structure that holds many values like a list. But dictionaties use keys as indexes and each key is mapped to a value (Pythons version of map from Java) 

my_cat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'age': 17}
my_cat[size] = fat

size being the key and fat being the value

items in a dictionary are unordered (unlike lists) so there is no first or last element
meaning if we do dict1 == dict2 if both hae the same key value pairs, this statement will return true regardless of the order

For if statements we can use the in keyword for boolean statements to look for specifc keys in a dictionary
birthdays = {'Alice': 'Apr 1', 'Bob': 'Dec 12', 'Carol': 'Mar 4'}
if name in birthdays:
	print(birthdays[name])

Returning Keys and Values
Dictionary return methods return list like values of the dictionary keys, values, or both
keys() returns a dict_keys data type object
values() returns a dict_values type object
items() returns a dict_items type object

spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
for v in spam.values(): v represents each value from the dictionary
for v in spam.keys(): v reperesents each key
for v in spam.items(): v represents each value and key together -> ('color', 'red') ('age', 42)

You can also use the in and not keywords
'color' in spam --> returns True

If we want to print the key and value pair with one loop we can use this- 
for k, v in spam.items():
...     print('Key: ' + str(k) + ' Value: ' + str(v))


Checking whether a Key exists in the dictionary
picnic_items = {'apples': 5, 'cups': 2}
'I am bringing ' + str(picnic_items.get('cups', 0)) + ' cups.' -> 'I am bringing 2 cups.'
'I am bringing ' + str(picnic_items.get('eggs', 0)) + ' eggs.' -> 'I am bringing 0 eggs.'

The 'cups' refers to the key we are looking for in the dictionary and the 0 is the default value that is returned if the key is not present
Since there is no key for 'eggs', the second get call returns 0

Checking is crutial. If we attempt to access a key not available it causes and error and can help us know when to create new ones when one does not already exist.

'I am bringing ' + str(picnic_items['eggs']) + ' eggs.'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-0>", line 1, in <module>
    'I am bringing ' + str(picnic_items['eggs']) + ' eggs.'
KeyError: 'eggs'

Results in error attempting to access a key that does not exist

Setting Default Values
Setting a value for a certain key that does not already have a value can be done with setdefault()

spam = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5}
spam.setdefault('color', 'black')  # Sets 'color' key to 'black'
spam.setdefault('color', 'white')  # Does nothing
spam = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5, 'color': 'black'}

Using setdefault doesnt work if the key already exists

Nested Lists and Dictionaries
You can store Lists within a list and the same for dictionaries. Most commonly associted with 2D arrays

all_guests = {'Alice': {'apples': 5, 'pretzels': 12},
              'Bob': {'ham sandwiches': 3, 'apples': 2},
              'Carol': {'cups': 3, 'apple pies': 1}}

def total_bought(guests, item):
	num_brought = 0
	for k, v in guests.items():
		num_brought = num_brought + v.get(item, 0)
	return num_brought


print('Number of things being brought:')
print(' - Apples         ' + str(total_brought(all_guests, 'apples')))
print(' - Cups           ' + str(total_brought(all_guests, 'cups')))
print(' - Cakes          ' + str(total_brought(all_guests, 'cakes')))
print(' - Ham Sandwiches ' + str(total_brought(all_guests, 'ham sandwiches')))
print(' - Apple Pies     ' + str(total_brought(all_guests, 'apple pies')))

Output:
 Number of things being brought:
 - Apples 7
 - Cups 3
 - Cakes 0
 - Ham Sandwiches 3
 - Apple Pies 1

Inside the total_brought function, the for loop iterates over the key value pairs in guests. Inside the loop, the string of the guest's name is assigned to k, and the dictionary of picnic items they are bringing is assigned to v. If the item exists as a key in the dictionary, its value (how many/quantity) is added to num_brought. If the get() reveals the key does not exist, the get() returns 0 and is added to num_brought.

Summary/TLDR:
Remember dict(Dictionary object name).values() - returns list like object with all values in the dictionary
			             .keys() - returns list like with all of the keys
				     .items() - returns both the keys and values

REMEMBER!! these are not lists and would need to be casted or list() to be turned into lists otherwise they will be something completely different
dict.setdefault() - sets a key in the dictionary with a value and cannot be used on a key that already exists
dict.get('eggs', 0) - 2 parameters, 1st is the key we are looking for and the 2nd is the value returned if the key is not in the dictionary

Lists and Dictionaries can have lists and dictionaries within themselves to add more complexity if needed (EX: 2d board, multiple items associted with one key)
