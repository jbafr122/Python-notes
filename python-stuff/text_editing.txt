CHAPTER 8
STRINGS AND TEXT EDITING

String literals - string values that appear in code
We cant use the ' character with string so we have to develop different ways to make it appear in the string

Double Quotes - Using the " instead of ' to represent a string
spam = "That is Alice's cat."

Escape Characters - allows you to use characters that are otherwise impossible to put into a string literal. An escape character is a backslash (\) followed by the character you want to use
spam = 'Say hi to Bob\'s mother.'
Without the \'s, Python would prematurely end the string value definition and cause errors

\' Single Quote
\" Double Quote
\t Tab
\n New line
\\ Backslash

>>> print("Hello there!\nHow are you?\nI\'m doing fine.")
Hello there!
How are you?
I'm doing fine.

Raw Strings - Ignores all escape characters

>>> print(r'The file is in C:\Users\Alice\Desktop')
The file is in C:\Users\Alice\Desktop

>>> print('Hello...\n\n...world!')  # Without a raw string
Hello...

...world!
>>> print(r'Hello...\n\n...world!')  # With a raw string
Hello...\n\n...world!

Multiline Comments - use """ to use multiline comments

Indexes and Slices - Strings use indexes and slices the same way Lists do

'   H  e   l   l   o  ,     w  o  r  l  d   !  '
    0  1   2   3   4  5  6  7  8  9 10  11 12
  -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2  -1

>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> greeting[0]
'H'
>>> greeting [4]
'o'
>>> greeting[-1]
'!'
>>> greeting[0:5]
'Hello'
>>> greeting[:5]
'Hello'
>>> greeting[7:-1]
'world'
>>> greeting[7:]
'world!'

In and not keywords with Strings - You can use the in and not keywords with Strings similarly to how they work for lists

'Hello' in 'Hello, World' -> True
'cats' not in 'cats and dogs' -> False

F-Strings - allows you to place variable names or entire expressions within a string. Uses the f prefix before4 starting quotation marks
>>> name = 'Al'
>>> age = 4000
>>> f'My name is {name}. I am {age} years old.'
'My name is Al. I am 4000 years old.'
>>> f'In ten years I will be {age + 10}'
'In ten years I will be 4010'

F-String alternatives: %s and format() - the %s format specifier that Python would replace with another string
>>> name = 'Al'
>>> age = 4000
>>> 'My name is %s. I am %s years old.' % (name, age)
'My name is Al. I am 4000 years old.'
>>> 'In ten years I will be %s' % (age + 10)
'In ten years I will be 4010'

format() - more features than %s, can specify which variable to replace instead of having a specific order
>>> name = 'Al'
>>> age = 4000
>>> '{1} years ago, {0} was born and named {0}.'.format(name, age)
'4000 years ago, Al was born and named Al.'

Upper and Lowercase with Python
upper() - used to make the string uppercase
spam = 'Hello, world'
spam = spam.upper() -> 'HELLO, WORLD'

lower() - used to make the string lowercase
spam = spam.lower() -> 'hello, world'

isupper() - checking if string is uppercase
spam = 'HELLO'
spam.isupper() -> returns True

islower() - checking if the string is lowercase
spam = 'hello'
spam.islower() -> returns True

isalpha() Returns True if the string consists only of letters and isnt blank

isalnum() Returns True if the string consists only of letters and numbers (alphanumerics) and isnt blank

isdecimal() Returns True if the string consists only of numeric characters and ist blank

isspace() Returns True if the string consists only of spaces, tabs, and newlines and isnt blank

istitle() Returns True if the string consists only of words that begin with an uppercase letter followed by only lowercase letters

startswith() Returns True if a string starts with the phrase passed in 

endswith() Returns True if a string starts with the phrase passed in

join() Joins list of strings into one string
', '.join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats'])
'cats, rats, bats'
Comma works as a delimeter to know what to separate each string by

split() splits a string based on the string passed in into a list of stirngs (uses space by default)
>>> 'MyABCnameABCisABCSimon'.split('ABC')
['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon']
>>> 'My name is Simon'.split('m')
['My na', 'e is Si', 'on']

rjust() reutrns a padded version of the string with white space shifted to the right (number passed in determines how far left the string moves)

ljust() returns a padded version of the string with space shifted to the left (number passed in determines how far left the string moves)

center() centers the string passed in

strip() removes whitespace in a string

paperclip.copy() - attaches the passed in phrase to the clipboard

paperclip.paste() - pastes whatever the clipboard is holding
