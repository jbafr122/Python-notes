CHAPTER 9
TEXT PATTERN MATCHING WITH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

We use regular expressions and patterns to match and simplify processes to take 3 steps rather than 3000
Like looking for "-" in phone numbers or any character separating a group of numbers 
This pattern matching method refers to a regular expression

Regular expressions, called regexes for short, are a sort of mini language that describes a pattern of text. For example, the characters \d in a regex stand for a decimal numeral between 0 and 9. 
Note that we often write regex strings as raw strings, with the r prefix. This is useful, as regex strings often have backslashes. Without using raw strings, we would have to enter expressions such as '\\d'.

We'll stick with the example regular expression string r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}' used to find US phone numbers in a text string 'My number is 415-555-4242'. 
1.Import the re module. All regex functions in Python are in the re module

2.Pass the regex string to re.compile() to get a Pattern object.

3.Pass the text string to the Pattern object's search() method to get a Match object.

4.Call the Match object's group() method to get the string of the matched text.

>>> import re
>>> phone_num_pattern_obj = re.compile(r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}')
>>> match_obj = phone_num_pattern_obj.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')
>>> match_obj.group()
'415-555-4242'
