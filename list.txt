CHAPTER 6
Lists

List - A value that holds multiple values in a sequence and delimited by a comma

Indexing into a list
spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
spam[0] -> cat
spam[1] -> bat
... and so on

Negative indexing - Indexes start at 0 and go up. So -1 refers to the last index in a list and -2 would be the second to last index and so on
spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elepahnt']
spam[-1] -> elephant
spam[-2] -> rat

Slices - Several values from a list instead of just one
spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elepahnt']
spam[0:4] -> ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elepahnt']
spam[1:3] -> ['bat', 'rat']
spam[0:-1] -> ['cat', 'bat', 'rat']
spam[:2] -> ['cat', 'bat']

len funtion - returns the length of a list
spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elepahnt']
len(spam) -> 4

Concatenation of strings is possible
[1, 2, 3] + ['A', 'B', 'C'] -> [1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C']

del function - removes a value from the list
del spam[2] # value in index 2 is removed

in and not operators with lists
You can use the in and not operators to create boolean expressions to determine if a value is in a list or not
'howdy' in ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas'] -> returns True

List methods
Use this for reference spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
index() - find the index of value passed in
spam.index('hello') -> 0

append() - adds new value to list
spam.append('moose') -> spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas', 'moose']

insert() - adds new value to list at a specific index
spam.insert('moose', 1) -> spam = ['hello', 'moose', hi', 'howdy', 'heynas']

remove() - remove value from list
spam.remove('hello') -> spam = ['moose', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heynas']

sort() - sorts
spam.sort()

reverse - reverses
spam.reverse()

You can index into a string and tuple like a list
name = 'Zophie'
name[0] = 'Z'
Note that this would be a str since python does not have char values like Java and C

Lists are a mutable data type (you can add, remove, or change values)
Strings are immutable. Attempting to reassign an index of a String will result in error
name = 'John' 
name[0] = 'b' -> ERROR (TypeError to more specific)

Tuples are immutable

List and Tuple Conversion
tuple() - changes list into tuple type
list() - changes tuple into list type
list() can also be used to make a string into list type 
list('hello') -> ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] # Could be used to modify a string since string types are immutable

To go from list to string use .join function
new_string = ', '.join(list) #the ',' works as a seperation between each string at each index
Also for this to wotk each element needs to be a string
use str() type cast if another type
EX: if an elemnent was an int
new_string = ', '.join(str(num) for num in list))
