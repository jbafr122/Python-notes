CHAPTER 7 - Dictionaries and stuff

Dictionary is a mutable data structure that holds many values like a list. But dictionaties use keys as indexes and each key is mapped to a value (Pythons version of map from Java) 

my_cat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'age': 17}
my_cat[size] = fat

size being the key and fat being the value

items in a dictionary are unordered (unlike lists) so there is no first or last element
meaning if we do dict1 == dict2 if both hae the same key value pairs, this statement will return true regardless of the order

For if statements we can use the in keyword for boolean statements to look for specifc keys in a dictionary
birthdays = {'Alice': 'Apr 1', 'Bob': 'Dec 12', 'Carol': 'Mar 4'}
if name in birthdays:
	print(birthdays[name])
