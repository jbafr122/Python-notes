assert - statement to check if something is true and if it is not then the entire program stops. works like a sanity check when debugging code.
>>> ages = [26, 57, 92, 54, 22, 15, 17, 80, 47, 73]
>>> ages.sort()
>>> ages
[15, 17, 22, 26, 47, 54, 57, 73, 80, 92]
>>> assert ages[0] <= ages[-1]  # Assert that the first age is <= the last age.

raise - used to raise an exception in your own code. a way of saying "stop running the code and move into the except statement.
def box_print(symbol, width, height):
    if len(symbol) != 1:
      ❶ raise Exception('Symbol must be a single character string.')
    if width <= 2:
      ❷ raise Exception('Width must be greater than 2.')
    if height <= 2:
      ❸ raise Exception('Height must be greater than 2.')

    print(symbol * width)
    for i in range(height - 2):
        print(symbol + (' ' * (width - 2)) + symbol)
    print(symbol * width)

try:
    box_print('*', 4, 4)
    box_print('O', 20, 5)
    box_print('x', 1, 3)
    box_print('ZZ', 3, 3)
❹ except Exception as err:
  ❺ print('An exception happened: ' + str(err))
try:
    box_print('ZZ', 3, 3)
except Exception as err:
    print('An exception happened: ' + str(err))

This program uses the except Exception as err form of the except statement ❹. If an Exception object is returned from box_print() ❶ ❷ ❸, this except statement will store it in a variable named err. We can then convert the Exception object to a string by passing it to str() to produce a user-friendly error message ❺. When you run this boxPrint.py, the output will look like this:
